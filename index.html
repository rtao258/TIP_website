			<h2>Hangman</h2>
			<p>
			The hangman project focused on basic elements of Python such as if/else statements and for loops. 
			The goal was to build a functioning hangman game.
			I wrote a Python module that can be used to make your own hangman game easily.
			</p>
			<p class="caption">The following Python code is part of the hangman module.</p>

@staticmethod
def guess_char(parsed_chars, guess):
    """ Modifies the parsed char list as necessary for a guessed character in the word """
    correct = False
    solved = True
    # First, validate char
    if not Text.validate_char(guess):
        print("That's not a single letter! Try again.")
        correct = True
        return parsed_chars, correct
    # Look for matching characters
    for i in range(len(parsed_chars)):
        char = parsed_chars[i][0]
        if char == guess:
            correct = True
            parsed_chars[i][1] = True
    # Check if all characters are guessed correctly
    for char in parsed_chars:
        if char[1] == False:
            solved = False
    if solved:
        print("You solved the hangman puzzle!")
    # Print a message to the console
    elif correct:
        print("\"{}\" is correct!".format(guess))
    else:
        print("\"{}\" is incorrect!".format(guess))

			<h2>Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>
			<p>
			The tic-tac-toe project focused on basic Python skills as well.
			It was slightly harder.
			I made my own GUI for the game, however, it wasn't working very smoothly.

def init_board(screen, render, space, center=True):

# First, define some local variables
# Initialize the board which will hold the boxes
board = [[],
         [],
         []]

# Unpack the screen size tuple
screen_x = screen.get_size()[0]
screen_y = screen.get_size()[1]
# Unpack render to get values needed to render identical boxes

			<h2>Pac-Man</h2>
			<p>
			The Pac-Man project focused on topics in computer science, particularly search algorithms.
			The goal was to write an AI for Pac-Man to eat the dots.
			This used two kinds of searching algorithms, Depth-First Search and Breadth-First Search.
			</p>
			<p class="caption">The following algorithm implemented in Python was used in both Depth-First Search and Breadth-First Search.</p>
			<pre>
def genericSearch(problem, structure):
    fringe = structure();
    expanded = set();
    fringe.push((problem.getStartState(), [], 0));

    while not fringe.isEmpty():
        curState, curMoves, curCost = fringe.pop();

        if (curState in expanded):
            continue;

        expanded.add(curState);

        if problem.isGoalState(curState):
            return curMoves;

        for state, direction, cost in problem.getSuccessors(curState):
            fringe.push((state, curMoves + [direction], curCost));
    return [];

			<h2>Final Project</h2>
			<p>
			There were many options for the final project.
			I chose to make a text adventure game.
			This is going to be a challenge to code!

			This website is a showcase of my projects at the Modern Programming course at Duke TIP's Summer Studies Program at Georgia Tech, 2017.
			This website was completely written from scratch with its own HTML and CSS.
			This website is also fairly mobile-friendly; try changing the width of your browser and notice how everything resizes.
